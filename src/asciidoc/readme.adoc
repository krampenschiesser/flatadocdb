# FlatAdocDB

## Main goals

* Store asciidoctor and other text/json files hierarchical in the file system
* Storage has to be *Atomic* and *Isolated*, Consistency and Durability are not the main goals( After close of stream I hope that it is written to the FS, as there are (almost) no relations, consistency is no issue either)
* In process database
* Support versioning via GIT(jgit), including support for submodules to get a distributed storage that can be synced
* Support searching via apache lucene
* Provide an easy to use API similar to the JPA EntityManager

## JTA integration

In order to integrate with application servers FlatAdocDB uses JTA.
To resolve the important classes of JTA the using developer has to provide an implementation of the class *de.ks.flatadocdb.session.transaction.JTAProvider*.
The implementation is resolved vai that Java https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html[ServiceLoader] infrastructure.

## Usage without JTA

Generally if no JTAProvider can be resolved we fall back to our own transaction management.
