# FlatAdocDB

## Main goals

* Store asciidoctor and other text/json files hierarchical in the file system
* Storage has to be *Atomic* and *Isolated*, Consistency and Durability are not the main goals( After close of stream I hope that it is written to the FS, as there are (almost) no relations, consistency is no issue either)
* In process database
* Support versioning via GIT(jgit), including support for submodules to get a distributed storage that can be synced
* Support searching via apache lucene
* Provide an easy to use API similar to the JPA EntityManager
