### The repositories

We can manage multiple repositories. +
One repository is the same as you are used to in git. +
However it is additionally the root path for one single FADB. +
-> Do we need 1 global or multiple indexes? What does lucene recommend?


### Managing and referencing objects

In the beginning I thought referencing an object by an incremental ID is enough.
However if the same repository is cloned twice this is not possible anymore.
But as each file has a unique path inside the repository, this path can be used as identifier.
To shorten it we use the hash(SHA1) of the relative path. +

Renaming the project/file will cause a new id.
Renaming = Delete + Create completely new.

### Indexing

We scan and index all files in order to prevent having them all in memory.
If checksums don't match or new files are added we will scan those again.
Additionally we maintain a full lucene index.

### File+Folder naming

There is one annotation based policy that defines how the folders are named if the files get into subfolders or one folder.

### Git integration

After each transaction commit a git commit is done. However there is no need to commit it successfully.
Additionally syncs with external devices/computers can be done via git.

### Large files

Large files will pollute git and external devices.
Therefore a threshold is definded for files coming into the large binary folder.
This folder is not in git and needs to be synced manually.

### Optimistic locking

Simple version counter that is checked before and after flushing to ensure that no change is done.
If there is already one flushfile we will immediatly fail with a staleobjectstateexception.

### Lazy loading

References can be lazily loaded. Which will prevent too much memory consumption.

### Parent child behaviour

Usually the folder and file of an entity is defined by its main(class) annotation.
However if it is a member and annotated with @Child new folder and file naming is chosen depending on

* If the child contains a specialized folder+naming strategy
* Or non is defined and its child folder + name is defined by the main(class) annotation

### Commit and flush phase

Before the commit we need to flush our changes.
This is done by creating a temporary and hidden(including file attribute and prefix dot) file.
Its name is the following:

. *.* a dot for hiding it on unix system
. *filename.ext.* depeding on the given rules
. *pid_host* defining the pid and host of the process and system owning it.
** this is needed in order to be secured against a killed program that didn't delete that file.
** However this is only working if the file is written by the local machine.
. *.flush*

*.myNeededTask.MyExt.2274@192.168.170.14.flush*

#### Shutdown hook

We add a shutdown hook to ensure that those flush files are deleted again.
